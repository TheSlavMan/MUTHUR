  # ======== MUTHUR – Site Stage Events ========
  MUTHUR_scotland_site_desc:0 "Centuries-old petroglyphs and burial cairns hint at star-charts hidden beneath the moors."

  # Scotland stage events
  MUTHUR_scotland_stage1_title:0 "Stone and Sky"
  MUTHUR_scotland_stage1_desc:0 "Surface surveys corroborate oral histories: recurring motifs of giants pointing to the heavens. Excavation crews report a vaulted chamber sealed with resin-like stone."

  MUTHUR_scotland_stage2_title:0 "The Chamber Below"
  MUTHUR_scotland_stage2_desc:0 "We’ve mapped a spiral descent ending in a circular room etched with a stellar configuration. The pattern matches no catalogued chart. Funding an off-world expedition could validate the hypothesis."
  MUTHUR_scotland_fund:0 "Fund the Expedition"
  MUTHUR_scotland_fund_tt:0 "Allocate [engineering_research] to outfit a dedicated survey vessel and crew."

  # LV-223 site events
  MUTHUR_lv223_site_desc:0 "Telemetry isolates a barren moon with anomalous internal voids and trace atmospheric toxins. Artificial structures breach the surface."
  MUTHUR_lv223_stage1_title:0 "Hollow Structures"
  MUTHUR_lv223_stage1_desc:0 "The exterior promises geology, the interior whispers design. Cavernous corridors honeycomb the substructure."
  MUTHUR_lv223_stage2_title:0 "Urns of Black Fluid"
  MUTHUR_lv223_stage2_desc:0 "Amphorae-like canisters exude non-volatile particulates. Automated samplers refuse to classify the medium."
  MUTHUR_lv223_stage3_title:0 "The Signal"
  MUTHUR_lv223_stage3_desc:0 "A repeating pulse from deep within the complex. Our team believes it’s a control signal — or a warning."

  # Country-event UI text you referenced earlier
  MUTHUR_scotland_2_title:0 "Appropriations"
  MUTHUR_scotland_2_desc:0 "Archaeological evidence points off-world. With sufficient funding, we can dispatch a privately crewed research vessel to follow the chart."
  MUTHUR_begin_surface_exp:0 "Commence Surface Expedition"
  MUTHUR_lv223_c1_title:0 "First to LV-223"
  MUTHUR_lv223_c1_desc:0 "Our expedition secured the site ahead of the competition. Preliminary surveys recommend a formal excavation of the moon’s interior."
  MUTHUR_lv223_loser_title:0 "Too Late"
  MUTHUR_lv223_loser_desc:0 "Rival contractors have established first rights at the target moon. We’ll monitor signals and await secondary opportunities."
  MUTHUR_lv223_final_title:0 "Residuals"
  MUTHUR_lv223_final_desc:0 "The complex lies silent. Environmental drift masks a recurrent sub-surface ping. Colonial protocols advise caution."
  MUTHUR_logs_title:0 "Recovered Logs"
  MUTHUR_logs_desc:0 "Fragmentary mission recordings surface from the target moon — half-redacted, all alarming."
  MUTHUR_logs_colony_desc:0 "The colony’s internecine channels contain black-box fragments from the original expedition. There’s more beneath the dust."

  MUTHUR_infest_stage2_title:0 "Missing Persons"
  MUTHUR_infest_stage2_desc:0 "Patrols come back a head-count short. Drains clog with black particulate. Something is nesting in our blind spots."
  MUTHUR_infest_stage3_title:0 "Outbreak"
  MUTHUR_infest_stage3_desc:0 "Emergency channels chatter with the same word: *CONTACT*."
  MUTHUR_infest_reveal_title:0 "Containment Measures"
  MUTHUR_infest_reveal_desc:0 "We can attempt to restore order, or we can scour the area from orbit. Neither promises certainty."
  MUTHUR_infest_success_title:0 "Containment Restored"
  MUTHUR_infest_success_desc:0 "Stability returns — brittle and uneasy."
  MUTHUR_infest_fail_title:0 "Signal Lost"
  MUTHUR_infest_fail_desc:0 "All telemetry from the surface ceases. Then the screaming starts."

  # Merger chain
  MUTHUR_merge_title:0 "Consolidation Talks"

The material in question originates from restricted research programs and was never approved for independent or third-party deployment.\n\nAn internal review is currently underway to determine the scope of the breach and identify points of compromise. All divisions in possession of related data have been instructed to enforce immediate access restrictions and suspend discretionary research sharing.\n\nSenior leadership has been briefed. Any unlicensed application of Weyland-Yutani intellectual property will be treated as a hostile infringement and addressed in accordance with corporate policy."

  MUTHUR_origin_weyland_desc:1 "Founded in 2012 by the visionary industrialist Peter Weyland, Weyland Corp rose to dominance with unprecedented speed, its vast portfolio of revolutionary patents granting it a market valuation unmatched at birth. By 2015, the corporation had extended its reach beyond Earth, launching Solstice orbital platforms capable of beaming energy across planetary distances.\n\nIn the decades that followed, Weyland Corp blurred the line between public institution and private empire. It financed deep-space scientific endeavors, uncovered microbial life beyond Earth, shattered market records, and decisively crushed all legal challenges to its technological supremacy. Human progress became inseparable from corporate ambition, with shareholders and executives alike guiding the future of the species.\n\nIn the early 2030s, Weyland engineers completed the Heliades - humanity's first faster-than-light capable vessel. With the barriers of interstellar distance finally broken, Weyland Corp now stands poised to export its monopoly beyond Sol, carrying its vision, its authority, and its profits to the stars."
