# MUTHUR — Alien Universe Project for Stellaris

**MUTHUR** is an expansive Stellaris mod that aims to bring the *Alien / Prometheus* extended universe into the Stellaris sandbox.  
This project aims to unify lore from films, novels, comics, games, and official reference guides into a coherent and playable Stellaris experience.

## 📖 Project Goals

- Represent factions such as **Weyland-Yutani**, **Seegson**, **USCSS / Colonial Marines**, **Union of Progressive Peoples**, **Engineer civilizations**, and **various Xenomorph strains**.
- Expand Stellaris with:
  - Custom origins, civics, traits  
  - Unique events, anomalies, and expedition chains  
  - Accurate systems and planetary features  
- Maintain lore consistency across the entire Alien canon where possible.
- Provide a flexible foundation for future modding, submods and community use.

- Colonial Marines Tech Manuals
